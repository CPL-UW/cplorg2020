description = "Mike Tissenbaum is a learning research scientist with the App Inventor team at MIT’s Center for Mobile Learning. Mike’s research, which focuses on collaborative learning and knowledge communities, aims to understand how children develop STEM and computational literacies when engaged in technology-enhanced learning. More broadly, Mike’s work focuses on how to design transformational learning environments that combine interactive physical spaces, digital information, and collaboration between learners to envision the future of learning both in and out of schools. In this work, Mike has developed immersive technology-rich learning environments in which students have taken on the role of animals that need to physically explore their habitat for food; acted as engineers to help biologists discover new forms of aquatic life; and collectively explored the physics of hollywood movies. Mike's work has gained recognition internationally, receiving awards both for his academic research and museum exhibit design."
